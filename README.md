Module 6 challenge

**WeatherPy**

generate random list of cities using the citypy library   
using weather API key, add the latitude, longitude, max temp, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and date of the capture to this list of cities
this is then saved as a dataframe and exported to csv

scatter plots were generated comparing Latitude to Humidity, Temperature, Cloudiness, Wind Speed.
linear Regression is then calculated and displayed.  Images of these are saved for review

**VacationPy**

read a csv file and created a dataframe
created a map plotting all the cities onto a map

reduce the city list by specified temperature range and humidity to for idea weather conditions
create a new dataframe to add a hotel to this list of cities
using the geoapify API, plot the cities where there is a hotel in the ideal weather condition range and have the hotel detail available to read when hovering over.
